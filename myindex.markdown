Iâ€™m a K-12 Computer Science (CS) teacher and CS education researcher.

My current research is primarily centered on Educational Robotics, Embodied Learning, Computational and Scientific Thinking. I am particularly interested in exploring and applying the embodied cognition view, mainly in the context of CS education, helping young learners comprehend abstract computational and STEM concepts with the use of computationally enhanced manipulatives.

I have a Ph.D. in Educational Robotics from [Ionian University](http://di.ionio.gr/en/), a master's degree in Ubiquitous Computing from [Hellenic Open University](https://sst.eap.gr/en/), and a diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering from [Democritus University of Thrace](https://www.ee.duth.gr/en/).
