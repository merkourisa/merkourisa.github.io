Iâ€™m a K-12 Computer Science (CS) teacher and researcher.

My current research is primarily centered on educational robotics, embodied learning, computational and scientific thinking. I am particularly interested in exploring and applying the embodied cognition view, mainly in the context of CS education, helping young learners comprehend abstract computational and STEM concepts with the use of computationally enhanced manipulatives.

I have a Ph.D. in Educational Robotics from the [Department of Informatics at the Ionian University](http://di.ionio.gr/en/), a master's degree in Ubiquitous Computing from the [School of Science & Technology at the Hellenic Open University](https://sst.eap.gr/en/), and a diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the [Polytechnic School at the Democritus University of Thrace](https://www.ee.duth.gr/en/).
